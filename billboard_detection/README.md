# Billboard Detection Project

## Overview
The Billboard Detection project is designed to detect billboards in images using advanced computer vision techniques. It leverages deep learning models and Spark for efficient data processing and model training. The project includes various components such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, and detection pipelines.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/billboard_detection.git
   cd billboard_detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Install the package locally:
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage
To run the main application, execute the following command:
```
python main.py
```

### Notebooks
The project includes Jupyter notebooks for various tasks:
- **01_data_exploration.ipynb**: Explore the dataset and visualize data distributions.
- **02_model_training.ipynb**: Train the model and evaluate its performance.
- **03_detection_pipeline.ipynb**: Integrate data loading, preprocessing, and model inference.
- **04_size_text_analysis.ipynb**: Analyze sizes and text extracted from detected billboards.
